| T3204750 | Check that the "snapshot" key isn't necessary and the user can create the Vitess source connector without (or an empty) this key (By default is true -> data that was added before starting the pipeline will be transferred)                     | Passed |         |
| T3204751 | The user can't create the Vitess source connector with an invalid values in the "snapshot" key (for example enter any text or digits, except for valid values) -> the system returns an error                                                     | Passed |         |
